These test cases are for testing the functionality of a web application that has a login and signup feature.
The tests cover various scenarios, such as visiting the login/signup page, checking the input types, displaying errors when the user does not exist or
when the password is incorrect, and successfully logging in and signing up. 
The tests also include verifying that the correct URLs are displayed after certain actions are taken, such as clicking the login or sign up button.

The Login Tests include checking that the login page can be visited, checking the input types for email and password fields, 
verifying that error messages are displayed when the user does not exist or the password is incorrect, and verifying that a successful login redirects the user to the correct URL. 
The Logout Test verifies that the logout button is visible and functions correctly.

The Signup Tests include checking that the signup page can be visited, checking the input types for the email, password, and confirm password fields,
verifying that error messages are displayed when the user already exists, and verifying that a successful signup redirects the user to the correct URL.

In this project I have used TestNg, Selenium WebDriver and Java.
